# Project Title

This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application that leverages the power of MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js to provide a robust and scalable solution for database connectivity.

## Backend

The backend of this application is built using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime, along with Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. The combination of these technologies allows for efficient handling of HTTP requests and responses.

The application is connected to a MongoDB database, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents for data storage. The main file in the backend includes methods for GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations, enabling the application to perform a full range of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is currently under development. Once completed, it will provide a seamless user interface for interacting with the backend, making it easy for users to perform CRUD operations.

## Features

- CRUD Operations: The application can perform all CRUD operations, providing a flexible interface for database management.
- Scalable Backend: Built with Node.js and Express.js, the backend can handle numerous requests efficiently.
- Flexible Database: MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable solution for database management.
- Under Development Frontend: The frontend, currently under development, will provide a user-friendly interface for database operations.

## Tools and Frameworks

- MongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database.
- Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Git: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- GitHub: A web-based hosting service for version control and collaboration.

## Future Scope

The frontend of the application is currently under development. Upon completion, it will provide a seamless user experience, making it easy for users to interact with the database. The frontend will be built with a focus on usability, ensuring that users of all levels can easily perform CRUD operations.
